            <h1>Pizza Recipie</h1>
            <p>Making pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself
                requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to
                be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the
                cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and
                enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation.</p>

            <h1>Fruit Salad Recipie</h1>
            <p>Bring orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, orange zest, and lemon zest to a boil in a saucepan over
                medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
                Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to cool.Layer the fruit in a large, clear glass
                bowl in this order: pineapple, strawberries, kiwi fruit, bananas, oranges, grapes, and blueberries. Pour
                the cooled sauce over the fruit. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours before serving.</p>

            <p> It is scrumptiously creamy and brings a delightful twist to the fresh and bright tastes of the
                vegetables we already know and love. Ginataan is particularly popular in places like the Bicol region.
                Bicolanos love two things in their food: coconut milk and lots of spice! With dishes like laing and
                Bicol Express under their belt, it’s no surprise that these people really go nuts for coconuts. While
                ginataan works well as a twist to savory dishes like Ginataang Kalabasa at Sitaw.</p>
